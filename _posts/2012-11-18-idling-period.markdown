Thanks God, I have had my bachelor degree (S.Kom) since last month and the ceremony will be held on 24th of this month.

I am no longer a student and now can be considered an alumni in my campus. That means my student card can no longer be used as ticket to campus library. The librarian told us to use alumni card instead or pay a visit fee as an outsider. Sigh, my student card has already been expired while I don't have an alumni card yet. But, it can still be used at video rentals, rite? *evilsmirk*

Have nothing to do in campus, make me extra "selo" and often found lurking in internet cafe because my broadband connection at kost has been went off. Now, I will pursue master degree in information engineering in UGM while doing some [oDesk part-time jobs](https://www.odesk.com/users/~~c49dac7a4987796b). Wish me goodluck :D

Speaking of S.Kom, it reminds me of my _senpai_ who named his business after his own title, "Ayam Geprek Eskom" (literally Eskom smashed chicken) and it's both funny and inspiring. Hey, any plan to change it to "Ayam Geprek Emkom" somedays? :D
