Ok, it's not the first time I got this email, yet I am too lazy to move to another provider. They tell me my password as PLAIN TEXT by e-mail, that's so frustrating about how they violated users' privacy. If they can tell us our password (even when it's automated by system) in plain text (I mean, without some encryption or at least masking) that's mean they (or their employee who has access to their internal system) can see our passwords.

Privacy, no?
