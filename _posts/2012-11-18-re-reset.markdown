Guess how many times have I been reset my blog? :p

It's been a long time since the last time I even visited this blog. Now I get back to it and find out that my blog has been flooded by SPAM!

Damn, no wonder my hosting provider keeps bugging me with annoying reminder emails saying that my account's disk usage has been exceeded the limit. The blog's database alone has a size of 23 Megabytes with no limit but using my account's global disk quota instead. Added with old posts' Â image files, it has been consuming 100% of my quota, and I have no intention on upgrading my hosting plan (yeah, it's cheap and operated by reputable hoster but sucks [in some area](http://akhyar.web.id/2012/11/web-hosting-service-knows-my-password/)).

It's better for me to re-reset it rather than dealing with those massive spams. Anyone can advise me how to make my WordPress blog more spam-proof without sacrificing visitors' convenience?
